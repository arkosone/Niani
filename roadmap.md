## Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: Faster Than Expected

**If breakthroughs happen early:**
- PhD → Immediate startup (2038)
- v1.0 by 2040 (5 years early)
- Widespread adoption by 2050
- Vision realized by 2060

**Don't count on it. Plan for realistic timeline.**

---

### Scenario B: Slower / Partial Success

**If physics limits or setbacks:**
- NIANI v1.0 = hybrid (not pure photonic)
- Commercial success, but vision partially unrealized
- Next generation inherits quest
- Still massive contribution

**This is OK. Progress > perfection.**

---

### Scenario C: Pivot Required

**If photonic neuromorphic hits wall:**
- Pivot to related field (optical computing, quantum photonics)
- Transfer knowledge, skills
- Different application, same principles
- Still valuable career

**Adaptability is key.**

---

## Commitment & Flexibility

### What's Fixed:
- ✅ Passion for photonics
- ✅ Vision of post-silicon era
- ✅ Open-source philosophy
- ✅ Long-term dedication

### What's Flexible:
- Exact architecture details
- Timeline (faster/slower OK)
- Academic vs startup path
- Pure vs hybrid approach

**The North Star (vision) doesn't change.**

**The route (tactics) adapts to reality.**

## How to Use This Roadmap

**Yearly review (every February):**
1. Check previous year's goals
2. Celebrate successes (even small)
3. Adjust upcoming year's targets
4. Update roadmap if needed

**Not a rigid plan.**

**A living document.**

**Courage to start. Humility to adapt. Persistence to finish.**
