## 🎯 Vision

Building a **new generation of computers** based on **light** instead of electricity, 
inspired by the **human brain** rather than von Neumann architecture.

**Ultimate goal (2050-2070):**  
100% photonic system with emergent general intelligence, 
progressively replacing the silicon/electrical paradigm.

---

## 🚀 Why NIANI?

### The Problem
- Current computers: Based on silicon, architecture unchanged for 70 years
- Growing energy consumption (datacenters = 2% of global electricity)
- Physical limits of silicon approaching (Moore's law slowing)

### The Solution
- **Photonics**: Light > Electricity (speed, parallelism, efficiency)
- **Neuromorphic**: Brain architecture > von Neumann (adaptability, learning)
- **Reconfigurable materials**: Hardware that learns (physical plasticity)

## 📊 Current Status

**Started:** February 2026  
**Phase:** Learning & Exploration  
**Creator:** High school student (Première S1, Senegal)

### Achievements
- ✅ Photonic simulation operational (MEEP)
- ✅ Understanding of guided wave propagation
- ✅ Material comparison (Si, glass, polymers)
- ⏳ NIANI architecture in design

## 🔬 Simulations

### [001 - Silicon Waveguide](simulations/001-silicon-waveguide/)
**First MEEP simulation**  
Observation: Light propagation in Si guide, strong confinement (~12 oscillations)  
Learning: Electromagnetic fields, guided waves, E ↔ B relationship

### [002 - Material Comparison](simulations/002-material-comparison/)
**Glass (ε=2.25) vs Polymer (ε=2.5) vs Silicon (ε=12)**  
Result: Refractive index n determines λ_material and confinement quality  
Conclusion: Si optimal for dense photonic circuits

## 🌍 Philosophy

### Why open-source (MIT)?

> *"I want to create. Open the way. Not for money, but for impact.*  
> *Even if I don't reach the ultimate vision alone, I'm laying the first brick."*

- **Transparency**: Code and progress public
- **Collaboration**: Community welcome
- **Legacy**: African technology inspiring the world
- **Impact > Profit**: Maximize adoption, not control

## 🇸🇳 Cultural Context

**Why "NIANI"?**

Niani was the **capital of the Mali Empire** (13th-14th century), one of the 
greatest African civilizations. The city symbolized knowledge, trade, and 
intellectual brilliance - home to scholars, scientists, and innovators.

This project honors that legacy: **African innovation** in cutting-edge technology, 
resisting Western tech dominance, and proving that breakthrough science can emerge 
from anywhere.

**Origin:** Dakar, Senegal 🇸🇳  
**Spirit:** Niani's intellectual tradition continues
